# Binary-Calculator
Binary Calculator made in Java that is able to add, subtract, and multiply same length binary numbers.
The project has 4 src files being: Binary calculator, BinaryCalculator Grader, BitField, and Constants.
The Binary Calculator file contains the actual code for the calculations of Add, Sub, and Mul for assembly coding. Uses the Bitfield class to hold the values.
The Binary Calculator Grader file contains multiple test cases with the ability to switch the amount of bits and size of tests.
The Bitfield class holds multiple constructors and methods to instantiate them. They create bit fields which are just arrays of boolean values to simulate binary code.
A 1 is true and a 0 is false. Multiple methods to facilate futher modifications such as a deep copy method. The constants class is a class that ensures that each 
bit field is a power of 2 which allows for shifiting and keeping each bit field the same size.
